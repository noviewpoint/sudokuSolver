## sudokuSolver

My idea for this project was to use the code from the "Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle" by Peter Norvig ( https://norvig.com/sudoku.html ) and transform it from Python v2 to functional ES6 JavaScript. 

I wanted to learn how generators work in ES6 and then use them in action to pause the execution of functions. I decided that the user should be able to pause the execution of sudoku solving methods by clicking a button. This way he is able to see the sudoku solving process step by step right in front of him in real time.

I also wanted to try github pages to host html app.

## How to run it

Run index.html locally from the browser. No server side needed.

## Languages used

HTML CSS vanilla JavaScript(ES6)

## State of this project

It's not a 100% complete but it works :) Understanding of ES6 generators went up a few levels though... :)
